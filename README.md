Save State (A Chrome Extension)
=================

**This extension does two task:** *It saves your tabs for later* AND *tells me all your secrets…*

Ermmm… Actually it only does the one task. (Probably not the later task.)

Save State is my first attempt at making a Google Chrome Extension so most of the code ISN'T pretty, but I'm happy to say the plugin does its job! As a bonus, it stays out of the users way.
